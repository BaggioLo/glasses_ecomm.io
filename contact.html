        <!-- For the header tag I wanted to create a landing page
            Customers should understand who we are and our company right away
            My nav (<nav>) whch has a class of "navbar" also included 3 very important items, a home button, product, and contact
            which is very relevant and useful information for customer experience,
            each also link to the relevant page using the (<a href>) tag ,
            there is an h1 tag in there as the company/logo
            For the button (<button>) I got a tiny bit fancy and added an onclick event
            so when you click on the button it says that "We are out of Inventory", the string will show up
            to let customers know that we have nothing to buy currently therefore it does not link to a different page-->

        Contact Us to give the form a title, I bolded the text to make it standout more as the title and gave it a text-shadow 1px 1 px to not make it too big
        I also set the color as the fuschia pink #ff0080 to go along with the theme of the website that I had for the hover effect -->

        I also set the inline style of the h2 tag to heebo and put the opacity of h2 and p to 0.5 so that it gives a little bit better
        visual balance. Its not a big part of the website, so I found no reason to keep the opacity at the same importance of the other content.
        Added br tags for line breaks -->

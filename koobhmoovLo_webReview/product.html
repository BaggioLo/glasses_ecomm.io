        <!-- For the header tag I wanted to create a landing page
            Customers should understand who we are and our company right away
            My nav (<nav>) whch has a class of "navbar" also included 3 very important items, a home button, product, and contact
            which is very relevant and useful information for customer experience,
            each also link to the relevant page using the (<a href>) tag ,
            there is an h1 tag in there as the company/logo
            For the button (<button>) I got a tiny bit fancy and added an onclick event
            so when you click on the button it says that "We are out of Inventory", the string will show up
            to let customers know that we have nothing to buy currently therefore it does not link to a different page-->

                            I realized that it could be used as kind of a second header if I placed it on the left hand side
                            which made it more functional, you can see it with (rowspan="6"). I also added padding to the left hand side
                            to give it a bit more breathing space. I changed the font family to Heebo as they were the more important text that 
                            outlined what exactly you were looking at. -->

        <!-- Per our video trainings, the aside tag was best used for ads. I gave the div the class of ad,
        I set an h2 in there to Put your ad here to potential businesses looking to get ad placement on our website,
        I also set the inline style of the h2 tag to heebo and put the opacity of h2 and p to 0.5 so that it gives a little bit better
        visual balance. Its not a big part of the website, so I found no reason to keep the opacity at the same importance of the other content.
        Added br tags for line breaks -->

        <!-- For the header tag I wanted to create a landing page
            Customers should understand who we are and our company right away
            My nav (<nav>) whch has a class of "navbar" also included 3 very important items, a home button, product, and contact
            which is very relevant and useful information for customer experience,
            each also link to the relevant page using the (<a href>) tag ,
            there is an h1 tag in there as the company/logo
            For the button (<button>) I got a tiny bit fancy and added an onclick event
            so when you click on the button it says that "We are out of Inventory", the string will show up
            to let customers know that we have nothing to buy currently therefore it does not link to a different page-->

        <!-- This is the main tag: I wrapped the contents with a div class of "Mission" to allow me to position it better with css
        I added the inline style of visibility hidden to some placeholder text, keeping note that more could be added to the mission
        statement at a later date, and so that it will not show up on customer screens. The mission is set as the main content, as 
        I felt it was important to the company and also has what our company actually does, and hopefully gets picked up easier on SEO -->

        <!-- This section is for the product and I put it within the section tags. Again I wrapped the entire content in a div class box1,
        I added an image with the div leftbox1 so I can move it with css to the left later, I added an image with the alt to my img src so the text shows up correctly if the image
        does not pop up and I added a display of none, I also set the z-index:1 so that it would stack correctly on the other content, but I set the style to display none
        as it was easier for me to later in the CSS to put the background image of the div as the product instead of maneuvering the image file. -->

            with the image of a happy customer, the alt text also shows the appropriate text incase the photo doesn't show up.
            I added a figcaption to go underneath the figure, as the testimonial of a happy customer. I also added an hr tag
            to give a bit of styling before heading into the ad section -->

        <!-- Per our video trainings, the aside tag was best used for ads. I gave the div the class of ad,
        I set an h2 in there to Put your ad here to potential businesses looking to get ad placement on our website,
        I also set the inline style of the h2 tag to heebo and put the opacity of h2 and p to 0.5 so that it gives a little bit better
        visual balance. Its not a big part of the website, so I found no reason to keep the opacity at the same importance of the other content.
        Added br tags for line breaks -->
